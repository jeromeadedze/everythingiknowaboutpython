    "A generator is a just function that returns an iterable object which we can iterate over ***(return one value at a time)***.\n",
    "\n",
    "- They are a simple way of implementing iterators\n",
    "\n",
    "- The main difference between a regular function and a Generator function lies in the use of `return` and `yield` statements respectively in Python.\n",
    "    - The difference between `return` and `yield` is that `return` terminates the function completely whiles `yield` pauses the function and saves it state for the next successive calls \n",
    "    - Each time the function encounters a `yield` statement, it temporarily suspends its execution, saves its internal state, and yields(provides) the specified value. The next time the function is called, it resumes from where it left off, continuing the execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Generators are useful when we want to produce a large sequence of values, but we don't want to store all of them in memory at once.\n",

    "## Differences Between Generator Function and Regular Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at all differences between a generator function and a regular function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A generator function includes one or more `yield` statements.\n",
    "2. It returns an iterator object but does not execute immediately.\n",
    "3. Methods such as`__iter__()` and `__next__()` are implemented automatically. It means that we can iterate through the items using next() or a `for` loop.\n",
    "4. Once the function yields, it is paused and the control is handed over to the caller.\n",
    "5. Local variables and their states are memorized between successive calls.\n",
    "6. When A generator function finishes, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Another difference is that generator functions don’t even run a function, it only creates and returns a generator object. Lastly, the code in generator functions only execute when next()  is called on the generator object or a for loop is used.\n",
