    "2. The \"while true\" loop in python runs without any conditions until the break statement executes inside the loop.\n",
    "3. To run a statement if a python while loop fails, the programmer can implement a python \"while\" with else loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ***while loop in python*** is a way to run a code block ***until the condition returns true repeatedly.*** Unlike ***the \"for\" loop in python***, the while loop ***does not initialize or increment the variable value automatically.*** As a programmer, you have to write this explicitly, such as \"i = i + 2\". It is necessary to be extra cautious while writing the python \"while\" loop as these missing statements can lead to an infinite loop in python. For example, if you forgot to increment the value of the variable \"i\" , the condition \"i < x\" inside \"while\" will always return \"True\". It is therefore advisable to construct this loop carefully and give it a read after writing.\n",
