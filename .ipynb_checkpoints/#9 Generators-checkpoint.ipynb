    "## Differences Between Generator Function and Regular Function\n",
    "\n",
    "Let’s take a look at all differences between a generator function and a regular function:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. A generator function includes one or more yield statements.\n",
    "2. It returns an iterator object but does not execute immediately.\n",
    "3. Methods such as__iter__() and __next__() are implemented automatically. It means that we can iterate through the items using next().\n",
    "4. Once the function yields, it is paused and the control is handed over to the caller.\n",
    "5. Local variables and their states are memorized between successive calls.\n",
    "6. When A generator function finishes, StopIteration is raised automatically on further calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "The main difference is that yield saves the state of the function. The next time the function is called, execution continues from where it left off, with the same variable values it had before yielding, whereas the return statement terminates the function completely. Another difference is that generator functions don’t even run a function, it only creates and returns a generator object. Lastly, the code in generator functions only execute when next() is called on the generator object.\n",
