    "     height= \"400px\"\n",

    "NB: \n",
    "- All CSV files are just plain texts(meaning they can be opened and read using any text editor or word processor), \n",
    "- they contain alphanumeric characters, \n",
    "- they of lines of text, with each line representing a row of data in the table. Within each line, the values are separated by commas (hence the name \"comma-separated\").\n",
    "- While CSV files can be opened and edited in programs like Excel, they are not the same format. CSV files do not have the advanced formatting capabilities of Excel files, such as font styles, colors, formulas, or data types. This means that in a CSV file, all values are treated as strings ***(meaning there is no inherent distinction between numbers, dates, or other data types within a CSV file)***. As a result, when opening a CSV file in a program like Excel, all values are initially treated as plain text.\n",
