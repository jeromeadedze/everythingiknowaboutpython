    "1. ***and*** : The And operator is used to verify whether both conditions associated with it are True Simultaneously. </br>\n",
    "In simple terms it checks whether whatever conditions on its left and right side are true. </br>\n",
    "If both conditions are true it returns True, if one is False returns False. </br>\n",

    "If one condition is False it will return True as long as the other condition is True\n",
    "3. ***not*** : It inverts results of booleans(returns the opposite of a Boolean)"
